KiCad Project - Balanced I/O PCB for SB4000 DIY project

This is a KiCad project to create a circuit and PCB to add balanced I/O to the External Sicdechain Send & Return on the Seprpent Audio "SB4000" DIY project.  I am not affiliated with Serpent Audio in any way.  I am using the repository as a versioning system for KiCad as I work out the circuit design and the PCB layout.
